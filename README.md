👋 Greeting
Hello! Meet me I’m Adnan, a data analytics enthusiast.
In the year 2025, I started chatting with AI / ChatGPT for different analysis ideas and techniques.
Finally, I got an idea and created a real-world dataset with AI for my own data analysis practice.

⚙️ Analysis Process
I combined all sheets into one master table for automation using Power Query (ETL process).
Then, I performed data cleaning   removing duplicates, filtering unnecessary rows, and preparing clean data for analysis.
After the cleaning step, I loaded the data into Excel and started creating visualizations and KPIs using Pivot Tables and Charts.
•	Created 9 Pivot Tables in total:
o	5 for KPIs: Total Sales, Total Quantity, Total Transactions, Max Sales, and Min Sales.
o	4 for charts and visual insights.
